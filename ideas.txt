Hello,

My idea is to create a simple n-body gravitational simulator.
I will be undertaking this by myself.

My idea is to meet the basic necessities, (geometry, lighting and texturing), then focus on rendering and computational performance.
Do you think I should instead focus on more complex graphics features?
Would it be possible to do an even simpler versions of the necessities and still get full marks? e.g. no specular lighting.

What is your opinion on the use of the OpenGL compute shader? While it is part of the OpenGL standard, it isn't strictly graphics related.
Would such a feature count towards the final grade?


Ideas are listed below, roughly increasing in difficulty:

Geometry
	+ Sim bodies from arbitrary .obj model - should be simple, e.g. sphere
	- Perhaps generate simple models for performance - point, triangle
	+ Use tesselation shaders in increase poly count based on distance from camera

Lighting
	+ Just basic ambient, defuse, specular

Texturing
	- Apply texture to background
	+ Each object in scene

Camera
	+ Flying camera - user controlled
	- Similar to first person view

Performance tweaking
	+ All unnecessary features which could harm performance can be dynamically toggled, such as texturing, advanced lighting and complex models
	+ Use instanced rendering for multiple identical bodies
	- Possibly use geometry shader for mass drawing - Requires OpenGL 3.2

Simulation
	+ Use basic/slow - n^2 algorithm
	+ Should implement boundaries for the bodies
	+ Boundary shape - sphere, infinite
	+ Dynamic simulator time step
	+ Implement compute shader for greater performance - Requires OpenGL 4.3



Thank you,
Michael.
